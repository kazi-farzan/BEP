I want each Div to be a class called page that has 100% height and width. 
All the gsap content goes in a separate file called gsap.js.
I want the site to load with Bio-Entrepreneurship Program written in a huge font in the center of the screen in green specifically #3EEB57 with a background of #111, and 2 buttons under it called "Registration" and  "Collaboration form". both buttons have text in #FDFADF and button is #111 with a border of #34E954.
Once the user scrolls, use gsap to transform this page to a navbar with buttons going to the top right and The title shrinking and sitting on the top left. and the whole page just shrinks to the size of a navbar. once this happens, I want other nav elements to fade in into a second row like "About Program","Timeline", "Domains", "Benefits", "Contact" under the 
 first row( with Bio-Entrepreneurship Program and buttons), both rows equal in size.
Next page is bout Program that shows all the details of the program in a sleek design.(we'll fine tune it later).




 The About Will just be the footer that has 4 well animated buttons with GSap,
